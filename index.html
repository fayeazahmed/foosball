				Hello, this is <a href="https://fayeazahmed.github.io/">Ahmed</a>. I
				thought of building
				<a href="https://www.github.com">this project</a> while trying to learn
				HTML Canvas. This is also the first project where I commented everything
				out properly so that anyone can understand whatever's happening
				wherever.<br />
				So basically there are two canvases. One is for drawing the background
				field only. Used this extra canvas so that the whole field doesn't have
				to be drawn at every render. Another canvas holds the actual dynamic
				game objects like handle, players and the ball. The movements were
				tracked in the 2d coordinate using
				<a href="https://joshbradley.me/object-collisions-with-canvas/"
					>Vector class</a
				>. This is the simplified version of what's happening in the game loop-
				Ball is constantly getting redrawn on current position and position is
				changing according to velocity. Ball direction and velocity changes when
				collided with other player or border according to handle state
				(leave/kick etc). If ball goes through any goal line, score is updated
				and everything is redrawn if a player scores ten.
