			<ul>
				<li>This is foosball (table football) tried on html canvas.</li>
				<li>
					Each side got 3 handles containing 5 mid players, 3 on defense and 1
					goalkeeper.
				</li>
				<li>
					After every goal, the ball is re-placed at mid of conceding team
				</li>
				<li>First side to score 10 goals wins, then match restarts.</li>
				<li>
					Single player is basically practice mode, where both sides have to be
					controlled. Main target is creating the live multiplayer version
				</li>
				<li>
					For multiplayer, enter your name and your position will be shown.
					<span style="color: blue">1- Blue [Left]</span>,
					<span style="color: red">2- Red [Right]</span>,
					<span style="color: grey">above- stand by and watch the match</span>
					(until I implement rooms) :v
				</li>
				<li style="color: #d20000">
					There is some kinda bad bug in multiplayer. Seems like one can move
					the handles of other players sometimes which isn't supposed to happen.
					It started occuring after deployment. So I think there MAYBE a chance
					that it's happening due to different screen sizes. Honestly I don't
					have any clue at this moment, will try to fix it later.
				</li>
				<li>
					Another bug is the handle positions don't get synced accurately all
					the time, but I think it's because of the slow req and response time
					of the free servers used to deploy it.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="text-start">Control:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Handle actions activate when cursor is close enough to the handle
				</li>
				<li>Rotate wheel to move handles</li>
				<li>Left click towards opponent goal to kick ball</li>
				<li>Left click towards own post to backpass</li>
				<li>Holding right button let the ball go underneath player</li>
				<li>Click wheel at right moment to hold ball using adjacent player</li>
				<li>While holding, rotate to move with the ball</li>
			</ul>

				Hello, this is <a href="https://fayeazahmed.github.io/">Ahmed</a>. I
				thought of building
				<a href="https://www.github.com">this project</a> while trying to learn
				HTML Canvas. This is also the first project where I commented everything
				out properly so that anyone can understand whatever's happening
				wherever.<br />
				So basically there are two canvases. One is for drawing the background
				field only. Used this extra canvas so that the whole field doesn't have
				to be drawn at every render. Another canvas holds the actual dynamic
				game objects like handle, players and the ball. The movements were
				tracked in the 2d coordinate using
				<a href="https://joshbradley.me/object-collisions-with-canvas/"
					>Vector class</a
				>. This is the simplified version of what's happening in the game loop-
				Ball is constantly getting redrawn on current position and position is
				changing according to velocity. Ball direction and velocity changes when
				collided with other player or border according to handle state
				(leave/kick etc). If ball goes through any goal line, score is updated
				and everything is redrawn if a player scores ten.
